# Unrolling Particles

This is the code used to run the experiments in the paper titled "Unrolling Particles: Unsupervised Learning of Sampling Distributions" submitted to the 47th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2022) by authors Fernando Gama, Nicolas Zilberstein, Richard G. Baraniuk and Santiago Segarra.

The seeds and parameters used to obtain the actual result are available upon request. Please, email fgama@rice.edu

The structure of the code is likely to be heavily improved on preparation for the journal version.

Any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Fernando Gama at fgama@rice.edu.
